I have worked at BWH, and MGH after the lab moved for three years. In this time, I co-authored a review paper soon to be published,
and have mainly worked on a project linking neurodegeneration with the disturbance of rest-activity patterns. The analytics were mostly 
performed using MATLAB and JMP, with some validation done using python. I presented the abstract at the SLEEP 2022 conference in Charlotte, NC, 
and am currently working on preparing the paper for publication.


At Cellino, I worked on a team of interns that created a precision fluidics system for controlled liquid flow, and an imaging setup
that could capture features of liquid flow from imaging data alone. This imaging setup used python and some image processing libraries 
including opencv and scikit-image, as well as some algorithms I developed personally. Finally, we integrated the systems to make a one-click 
setup that can flow liquid through a cell chamber in order to quantify a number of measures, most importantly the efficiency of liquid replacement.

In the Harvard Data Analytics Group, I have worked since coming to college as a case team analyst. I have used geographical and time-scale data
analytics techniques in order to draw insight into event sales data. We also created a number of machine-learning models that predicted event attendance
after ticket sales, and intuitive and interavtive maps to display geographic data. The process culminated in a presentation to my team's clients, in which we 
provided our insights, as well as a platform with which they could easily filter data and generate interactive maps that display regional sales.
